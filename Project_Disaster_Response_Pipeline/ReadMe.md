## Project Overview

In this project, I have applied data engineering & machine learning skills to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. This project majorly uses text analytics.

data directory contains a data set which are real messages that were sent during disaster events. I have created a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that appropriate disaster relief agency can be reached out for help.

This project will include a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.

Here are a few screenshots of the web app.
