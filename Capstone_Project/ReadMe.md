# Churn Prediction for music app - Sparkify
This project uses SparkML to predict user churn based on a 12GB dataset using a fictitious music service app, "Sparkify". For the complete analysis - please check out my blog post for more details!. Here is my [blog](https://medium.com/@shravankoninti/churn-prediction-for-music-app-sparkify-c40c194ca105)

## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.
The platform should also include all dependecies for running spark ML algorithms and data exploration functions.The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. 
These are the basic packages used:

* Python
* Spark
* Pyspark
* pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn


## Project Motivation
This is an Udacity Nanodegree Capstone project. Losing customers (churn) is an important business problem for any industry. If the organization is being able to predict churn can help a company to prioritize retention program on customers who are most likely to churn, taking actions even before a churn happens.

In this project, I used Spark ML programming to analyze user log activity dataset and build a machine learning model to identify users who are most likely to churn from the Sparkify App.


## File Descriptions
**User activity dataset** — 
The dataset logs user demographic information (e.g. user name, gender etc.,) and activity (e.g. song listened, event type, device.thumbs up, thumb down, downgrade done etc.,) at individual timestamps.

A small subset (~120MB) of the full dataset was used for exploratory data analysis and machine learning model development.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the code output and blog post. The blog post is available [here](https://medium.com/@shravankoninti/churn-prediction-for-music-app-sparkify-c40c194ca105)
