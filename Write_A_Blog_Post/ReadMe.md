## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I chose IPL 2006 to 2019 complete match dataset.

As a Cricket fan, it would be quite interesting to apply data analysis skills here.

My key interests would be:

  - Q1: What is the win percentage of a team batting second at Wankhede Stadium during 2008 to 2019? 

  - Q2: Which are the weekdays Kolkata Knight Riders wins the most?

  - Q3: Which is the best IPL team and how many times it had won in the past?  

  - Q4: Predict the winner of the match by just using the matches dataset fields? - This is a classic binary classification problem


## File Descriptions
**Deliveries** — Contains information about the match details at ball by ball. Some of the variables are over, ball, batsman, non_striker, bowler, is_super_over, wide_runs etc..,

**Matches** — Contains information about the match details like date, team1, team2, toss_winner, toss_decision, winner etc.,

There is also a notebook available here to showcase all my work related to questions I posted above.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the code output and blog post. The blog post is available [here](https://medium.com/@shravankoninti/ipl-cricket-data-analysis-6080bb7e9b52)
